`Programme Description`
- In 2004 Queen Mary teamed up with Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications (BUPT) to offer an innovative set of jointly run degree programmes in telecommunications systems and networks. The partnership is equally balanced in every sense – students graduate with two degrees - from BUPT and from the Queen Mary. Established in 1955 Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications is globally renowned for its ground-breaking research and teaching in the field of Telecommunications, Electronic Engineering and Computing.  It is officially designated a ‘Key University’ by the Ministry of Education – a privilege conferred only to China’s top 100 institutions – and in January 2013 it was officially ranked as being the top university in China for Information and Telecommunications Engineering.  Electronic Engineering and Computer Science at Queen Mary can trace its origin back s to the establishment of the Electrical Engineering  Department in 1888 and has always enjoyed a reputation for academic excellence, resulting in the two institutions being perfectly matched. The programme was developed to give students the combined academic expertise of both institutions and therefore the strengths of two distinct educational cultures – the mathematical and scientific rigour found in China and the emphasis placed on creative problem-solving and transferable skills in the UK. The two institutions’ strong links with industry are reflected in the programmes, as is their absolute commitment to training world-class professionals.  The international nature of the telecommunications industry, and the size and influence of China, mean students’ knowledge and understanding of local conditions are hugely attractive to employers.
